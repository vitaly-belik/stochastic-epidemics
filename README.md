The code was used to perform simulation for the spread of nosocomial pathogens (such as a resistant MRSA) on referral network of 
hospitals:

The repository contains a prototyte code for stochastic agent-based simulation of an epidemic spread on a metapopulation network. 
It uses the Gillespie algorithm with a priority queue. Movements of individuals 
between locations are pre-scheduled and given by a temporal network.
