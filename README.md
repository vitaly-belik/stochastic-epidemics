# stochastic-epidemics

The repository contains a prototyte code for stochastic agent-based simulation of an epidemic spread on a metapopulation network. 
It uses a Gillespie algorithm with a priority queue (similar to e.g. https://doi.org/10.1021/jp993732q). Movements of individuals 
between locations are given by a temporal network. 

The code was used to perform simulation for the spread of nosocomial pathogens (such as a resistant MRSA) on referral network of 
hospitals:
